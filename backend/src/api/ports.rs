//! Port pool API: port numbers Strom administers and hands out.
//!
//! The pool knows nothing about who is asking or what they do with the
//! numbers. An owner reserves some, renews while it is alive, and optionally
//! tells the pool which of them a given flow uses so they are not reclaimed
//! under a running pipeline.
//!
//! The pool is off until an operator configures ports. A server with none says
//! so rather than hiding: the reservation routes answer `503` with the setting
//! to change in the body, and `GET /api/ports` answers `200` either way with
//! `enabled: false`. A client can tell a Strom that will never hand out ports
//! from one that is briefly unhappy, and from an older Strom with no pool
//! routes at all, which answers `404`.
